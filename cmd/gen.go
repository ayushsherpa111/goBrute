	goBrute will then try and generate the sequence hash it and compare it to the supplied hash/hash file.
		*Format:
			?l : Lowercase Letter
			?u : Uppercase Letter
			?n : Number
			?s : Special Character
		Example:
			goBrute gen -f ?u?l?l?l?l?l?n 
			- generates a 7 character long password with 1 leading uppercase letter, 5 lowercase letters and 1 number

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// genCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// genCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
